This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with the JIT mode enabled.  The issue arises when a class name is used that isn't defined in your Tailwind configuration file.  This can happen due to typos, outdated configuration, or accidentally removing a class from your `tailwind.config.js` file.  This results in the class not being compiled and causing a CSS error or unexpected rendering.
