# Tailwind CSS JIT Mode Error: Undefined Class Name

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Tailwind CSS when using the JIT (Just-In-Time) mode.  The error occurs when a class name is used in your HTML or JSX that is not defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file.  This usually leads to the class being ignored, resulting in unexpected visual outcomes or CSS errors.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Start the development server (e.g., `npm run dev`).
4. Observe the unexpected styling in the browser; a class that should apply styling doesn't.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing your `tailwind.config.js` to ensure all class names used in your project are defined within the `content` array.  Also, thoroughly check for any typos in your class names within your HTML or JSX files. 

## Additional Notes
- This error is more likely to occur when using JIT mode because Tailwind only compiles classes that are actually used.  In non-JIT mode, more classes will likely be included in the final CSS output, masking this issue.
- Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` correctly points to the files containing your class names for JIT mode to work properly.
